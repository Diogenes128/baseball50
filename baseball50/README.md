The purpose of this project was to replicate a baseball fantasy simulation website. The user would be able to login into their unique account and recruit players either by choosing their starter team, choosing a free agent available through a randomized function, or through trade with other players. Some unique features that we included was a randomized free agent page to recruit players that have not been owned, a trade system between players, and a simulations page

**HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:**

To start, create an account through the register page to gain full access. If the user has a specific account with the interface already, then refer back to the login page. After logging in, the user will be redirected to the baseball50 page, which currently displays the batters and pitchers you own. Going to the rules page explains the main objective of the game, where you should recruit players onto your team to simulate for multiple seasons. In order to do that, you must choose a starter team, where you can click on the Choose Team page.

After choosing a team, you will be redirected to the baseball50 page where a list of the players will be displayed. Selling certain players with value to them will increase the amount of cash in your wallet, which can be used to recruit players on the Free Agents page.

Pressing on the Free Agents page in the navigation bar will show a list of randomly generated batters and pitchers that are not on your roster. With the money that you start with and any that you gain from selling your selected team, you can recruit stronger players by buying them.

Pressing the Trade page in the navigation bar, you can propose a trade with another user for certain players. First, you have to enter the username of another user whom you wish to trade players with. Furthermore, you have to select a player you want to offer to the other playerin a dropdown menu of your roster. Afterwards, you could request a player!


To finally play the game, press the stimulation button and input the year you want to simulate, where it will take some time for Gemini AI to review the current players on your roster to calculate the percentage of games that your team will win.
