PREMISE OF THE WEBSITE:
The purpose of this project was to replicate a baseball fantasy simulation website. The user would be able to login into their unique account and recruit players either by choosing their starter team, choosing a free agent available through a randomized function, or through trade with other players. Some unique features that we included was a randomized free agent page to recruit players that have not been owned, a trade system between players, and a simulations page

Going to the rules page, this explains the main objective of the game, where you should recruit players onto your team to simulate for multiple seasons. In order to do that, you must choose a starter team, where you can click onto the Choose Team page. After choosing a team, you will be redirected to the baseball50 page where a list of the players will be displayed. Selling certain players with a value to them will increase the amount of cash in your wallet, which can be used to recruit players in the Free Agents page.

With the money that you start with and any that you gained from selling your selected team, you can recruit stronger players.

Pressing the trade page in the navigation bar, you can propose a trade with another user for certain players.

To finally play the game, press the simulation button and input the year you want to simulate, where
